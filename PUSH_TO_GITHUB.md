### **Method 2: Using Terminal Commands**

**For a different GitHub account:**

1. **Clear any old GitHub credentials**:
   ```bash
   git credential-osxkeychain erase
   host=github.com
   protocol=https
   ```

2. **Push and authenticate**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. When prompted:
   - **Username**: Enter your GitHub username
   - **Password**: Enter a Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

4. **Get a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Check "repo" permission
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
   - Use this as your "password" when pushing

### **Method 3: Switch to HTTPS** (Works with different accounts)

```bash
# Update the remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pyrosolutionsinc/PYRO_WEBAPP.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

Then enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token when prompted.
