====================================
EASIEST WAY TO BACKUP TO GITHUB
====================================

THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Make sure you're signed in with your pyrosolutionsinc account
3. You should see "Publish branch" button
4. Click it
5. That's it!

IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:

The repository might have been created with commits. Let's delete it and start fresh:

A) Delete the existing GitHub repository:
   1. Go to: https://github.com/pyrosolutionsinc/PYRO_WEBAPP
   2. Click "Settings" (at the very bottom of the page)
   3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
   4. Click "Delete this repository"
   5. Type: PYRO_WEBAPP to confirm
   6. Click "I understand the consequences..."

B) Then in GitHub Desktop:
   1. Click "Publish branch"
   2. It will create a new repository
   3. Done!

OR JUST TELL ME:
