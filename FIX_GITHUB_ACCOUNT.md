# Fix: Move Repository to pyrosolutionsinc Account

## The Issue
Your code got pushed to the wrong GitHub account (`namen-victor`) instead of `pyrosolutionsinc`.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Create Repository Under pyrosolutionsinc Account

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
2. **Make sure you're logged into the `pyrosolutionsinc` account**
3. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
4. **Repository name:** `PYRO_WEBAPP`
5. **Make it Private** âœ“
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### 2. Push Your Code There

Once the repository is created, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/bukola/Projects/PYRO_WEBAPP
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pyrosolutionsinc/PYRO_WEBAPP.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify

Go to: https://github.com/pyrosolutionsinc/PYRO_WEBAPP

You should see all your code there!

## Why Did This Happen?

GitHub Desktop used the account that was logged in on your computer (`namen-victor`), not the `pyrosolutionsinc` account you wanted.

The fix is to:
1. Create the repository under the correct account (`pyrosolutionsinc`)
2. Change the remote URL in your local git to point to the correct repository
3. Push again
